The 3rd generation HHSOJ!

A light-weight, fast and portable OJ!

Currently in development phase.

**Note: This repository is NOT [XiaoGeNintendo/hhsoj](https://github.com/XiaoGeNintendo/hhsoj).**

**XiaoGeNintendo/hhsoj is a judge system built on Java SE and Swing. Often referenced as "hhsoj v1"**

This repository is a fork of [XiaoGeNintendo/HHSOJ-Essential](https://github.com/XiaoGeNintendo/HHSOJ-Essential).
However I changed the project structure so much that I decided to create a new repo instead of forking.
This version is equipped with Maven and other development tools.
