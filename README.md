# HHSOJ-Essential
The 3rd generation HHSOJ!

A light-weight, fast and portable OJ!

Currently in development phase.

Note: this repository is a fork of [XiaoGeNintendo/HHSOJ-Essential](https://github.com/XiaoGeNintendo/HHSOJ-Essential).
However I changed the project structure so much that I decided to create a new repo instead of forking.
This version is equipped with Maven and other development tools.
